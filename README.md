## Materials
This repository includes the following materials:

--Benchmark instances used in our paper (See the file named instances). One notices that the file also includes a set of depot configurations which are used for HGAMP. Of course, you can also adjust the code in commandline.h to overlook it. 
--Source codes of proposed HGAMP (See the source codes directory for the details.)   
--Detailed computational results and parameter analysis (See the detailed results directory for the details.)   
--Best solutions found in the experiments (See the certificate file for the details.)  
Note: The contents and formats of the files are demonstrated in the ReadMe file of corresponding subdirectory.
