Given that all benchmark instances used in this paper download from websites, we provide links to download all necessary instances and extract them under instances folder.
For depot configurations, given an instance, we use the program in Arnold, F., & SÃ¶rensen, K. (2021). A progressive filtering heuristic for the location-routing problem and variants. Computers & Operations Research, 129, 105166. to generate a set of depot configurations.
